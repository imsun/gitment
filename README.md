## Get Started

### 1. Install

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://imsun.github.io/gitment/style/default.css">
```

```html
<script src="https://imsun.github.io/gitment/dist/gitment.browser.js"></script>
```

or via CDN:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/gitment/style/default.css">
```

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/gitment/dist/gitment.browser.js"></script>
```

or via npm:

```sh
$ npm i --save gitment
```

```javascript
import 'gitment/style/default.css'
import Gitment from 'gitment'
```

### 2. Register An OAuth Application

[Click here](https://github.com/settings/applications/new) to register an OAuth application, and you will get a client ID and a client secret.

Make sure the callback URL is right. Generally it's the origin of your site, like [https://imsun.net](https://imsun.net).

### 3. Render Gitment

```javascript
const gitment = new Gitment({
  id: 'Your page ID', // optional
  owner: 'Your GitHub ID',
  repo: 'The repo to store comments',
  oauth: {
    client_id: 'Your client ID',
    client_secret: 'Your client secret',
  },
  // ...
  // For more available options, check out the documentation below
})

gitment.render('comments')
// or
// gitment.render(document.getElementById('comments'))
// or
// document.body.appendChild(gitment.render())
```

### 4. Initialize Your Comments

After the page is published, you should visit your page, login with your GitHub account(make sure you're repo's owner), and click the initialize button, to create a related issue in your repo.
After that, others can leave their comments.
   
## Methods

### gitment.render([element])

This function returns the element to which comments be rendered.

### gitment.renderHeader([element])

### gitment.renderComments([element])

Same like `gitment.render([element])`. But only renders comments list.


### gitment.renderEditor([element])

### gitment.init()

Initialize a new page. Returns a `Promise` and resolves when initialized.

### gitment.update()

### gitment.post()

Post comment in the editor. Returns a `Promise` and resolves when posted.

### gitment.markdown(text)

#### text

Returns a `Promise` and resolves rendered text.

### gitment.login()

Jump to GitHub OAuth page to login.

### gitment.logout()

Log out current user.

### goto(page)

#### page

Type: `number`

Jump to the target page of comments. Notice that `page` starts from `1`. Returns a `Promise` and resolves when comments loaded.

### gitment.unlikeAComment(commentId)

#### commentId

Type: `string`

Unlike a comment. Returns a `Promise` and resolves when unliked.

## Customize

Gitment is easy to customize. You can use your own CSS or write a theme.
(The difference is that customized CSS can't modify DOM structure)

### Use Customized CSS

Gitment does't use any atomic CSS, making it easier and more flexible to customize.
You can inspect the DOM structure in the browser and write your own styles.

### Write A Theme

A Gitment theme is an object contains several render functions.
 
By default Gitment has five render functions: `render`, `renderHeader`, `renderComments`, `renderEditor`, `renderFooter`.
The last four render independent components and `render` functions render them together.
All of them can be used independently.

You can override any render function above or write your own render function.

For example, you can override the `render` function to put an editor before the comment list, and render a new component.

```javascript
const myTheme = {
  render(state, instance) {
    const container = document.createElement('div')
    container.lang = "en-US"
    container.className = 'gitment-container gitment-root-container'
    
     // your custom component
    container.appendChild(instance.renderSomething(state, instance))
    
    container.appendChild(instance.renderHeader(state, instance))
    container.appendChild(instance.renderEditor(state, instance))
    container.appendChild(instance.renderComments(state, instance))
    container.appendChild(instance.renderFooter(state, instance))
    return container
  },
  renderSomething(state, instance) {
    const container = document.createElement('div')
    container.lang = "en-US"
    if (state.user.login) {
      container.innerText = `Hello, ${state.user.login}`
    }
    return container
  }
}

const gitment = new Gitment({
  // ...
  theme: myTheme,
})

gitment.render(document.body)
// or
// gitment.renderSomthing(document.body)
```

Each render function should receive a state object and a gitment instance, and return an HTML element.
It will be wrapped attached to the Gitment instance with the same name.

Gitment uses [MobX](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx) to detect states used in render functions.
Once used states change, Gitment will call the render function to get a new element and render it.
Unused states' changing won't affect rendered elements.

Available states:

- user: `object`. User info returned from [GitHub Users API](https://developer.github.com/v3/users/#get-the-authenticated-user) with two more keys.
    - isLoggingIn: `bool`. Indicates if user is logging in.
    - fromCache: `bool`. Gitment will cache user's information. Its value indicates if current user info is from cache.
- error: `Error Object`. Will be null if no error occurs.
- meta: `object`. Issue's info returned from [GitHub Issues API](https://developer.github.com/v3/issues/#list-issues).
- comments: `array`. Array of comment returned from [GitHub Issue Comments API](/repos/:owner/:repo/issues/:number/comments). Will be `undefined` when comments not loaded.
- reactions: `array`. Array of reactions added to current page, returned from [GitHub Issues' Reactions API](https://developer.github.com/v3/reactions/#list-reactions-for-an-issue).
- commentReactions: `object`. Object of reactions added to comments, with comment ID as key, returned from [GitHub Issue Comments' Reactions API](/repos/:owner/:repo/issues/comments/:id/reactions).
- currentPage: `number`. Which page of comments is user on. Starts from `1`.

## About Security

### Is it safe to make my client secret public?

Client secret is necessary for OAuth, without which users can't login or comment with their GitHub accounts.
Although GitHub does't recommend to hard code client secret in the frontend, you can still do that because GitHub will verify your callback URL. 
In theory, no one else can use your secret except your site.

If you find a way to hack it, please [open an issue](https://github.com/imsun/gitment/issues/new).

### Why does Gitment send a request to gh-oauth.imsun.net?

[https://gh-oauth.imsun.net](https://gh-oauth.imsun.net) is an simple open-source service to proxy [one request](https://developer.github.com/v3/oauth/#2-github-redirects-back-to-your-site) during users logging in.
Because GitHub doesn't attach a CORS header to it.

This service won't record or store anything. It only attaches a CORS header to that request and provides proxy.
So that users can login in the frontend without any server-side implementation.
